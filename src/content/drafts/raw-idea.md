title: "Unpolished Idea"
draft: true

This is just a collection of notes. It doesn't even need full frontmatter yet.
It lives in `src/content/drafts` and is just for me to look at in my editor.
It will NOT appear on the website, even in development mode, because it's not in one of the active collections (ai/library/xr).
