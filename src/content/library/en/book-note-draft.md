This file lives in `src/content/library/en/book-note-draft.md`.

Because `draft: true` is set:
- **Dev Mode (`npm run dev`)**: This post **WILL** appear in the Library list. You can click it and view it in the browser to check styling.
- **Production (`npm run build`)**: This post will be **EXCLUDED**. It will not generate a page or appear in lists.

When I am ready to publish, I just change `draft: true` to `draft: false`.
